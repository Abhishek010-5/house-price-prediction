## Introduction
This project utilizes **Lasso Regression** from the `scikit-learn` library for predictive modeling and various libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib` for data cleaning, manipulation, and visualization. The web interface is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while **Flask** is used for the backend development. The application can be used to analyze datasets and make predictions based on the model trained with cleaned data.

## Installation
To get started with this project, follow these steps:
1. **Clone the repository.**
2. **Navigate to the project directory.**
3. **Install the required Python packages.**

## Usage

### Data Cleaning and Training
1. **Load** the dataset using `pandas`.
